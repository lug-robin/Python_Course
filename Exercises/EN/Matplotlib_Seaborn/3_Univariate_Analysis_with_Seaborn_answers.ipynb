    "In fact, there are many visualization libraries for Python. We will explore **Seaborn**, which is built on top of the Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of Seaborn is the ability to create attractive, aesthetically pleasing plots integrating **Pandas DataFrame**s functionalities. So far, in order to create plots we always needed to 'extract' a Series of the DataFrame and then we were able to apply some plotting function. Seaborn, on the other hand, operates on the whole dataset, intelligently using labels of the `DataFrame` and internally performing the necessary steps. Seaborn makes creating visualizations very easy and intuitive by using high-level functions. "
